# **Project Challenge 3: ‚úçüèª Writing the Classes of a Game** üéÆ

This project challenge was proposed by the üë®üèª‚Äçüè´ professor: [Felipe Aguiar Silva]((https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipeaguiar-exe/)) (Felip√£o from DIO). It consists of creating a code that describes the classes of adventurer heroes of a fictional game based on 3 parameters (name, age, type) of a class.

The project required putting into practice the content learned throughout the course. Therefore, I used part of what I learned on this journey:

- Variables
- Operators
- Loops
- Decision structures
- Functions
- Classes and Objects
- Good Programming Practices.

For this project, I developed 3 files with different objectives based on the classes and content learned in this course.

## **File 1: Basic Classes with Methods**

In this first file, I combined the knowledge obtained about variables/contants, classes, objects and methods with decision structures (switch/case) and good practices for string concatenation and interpolation.

- **Variables and Types:** Declaration of properties (name, age, type).

- **Classes and Objects:** Creation of the Hero class and object instance (new Hero()).

- **Methods:** Function attack() within the class.

- **Decision Structures:** switch/case to define the attack according to the type.

- **Console Output:** console.log() to display messages.

## **File 2: Control Structures + Repetition**

In this second file, I applied the concepts of control structures (if/else) and repetition structures (for...of) to create a more dynamic system. I used arrays of objects to store the heroes and separate functions to better organize the program logic, demonstrating how to divide responsibilities in the code. I also practiced accessing object properties and iterating through lists, which are fundamental for data manipulation.

- **Conditionals (if/else):** Used to define attacks.

- **Loop (for...of):** Iteration over an array of heroes.

- **Objects in Arrays:** List of heroes containing objects.

- **Functions:** Method attack() and external function chooseAttack().

## **File 3: JSON + Separation of Logic**

In this third file I explored working with structured data without using classes, focusing on JavaScript objects and arrays. I implemented a solution where the hero data is separated from the attack logic, using pure functions that receive this data as parameters. This approach allowed me to better understand how to organize information into simple structures (such as arrays of objects) and how to write reusable functions that process this data, an essential concept for dealing with more complex information in the future.

- Conditionals (if/else): Used to define attacks.

- Loop (for...of): Iteration over an array of heroes.

- Objects in Arrays: List of heroes containing objects.

- Functions: Method attack() and external function chooseAttack().
